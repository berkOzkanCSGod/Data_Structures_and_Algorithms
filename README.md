# Data_Structures_and_Algorithms
Implementing data structures such as BST, AVLs, RB trees, Graphs, and some algorithms

Contributions are welcome!

Issues:
- Red Black tree rotation not working.

Data Structures
- Binary Search Tree
- AVL
- Red Black trees
- Max Heap
- Graph (Matrix)

Algorithms:
- Dijkstra's shorteset path (Graph)
- Breath and Depth-first traverse (Graph)
- Pre, in, and post-order traverse (Trees)

FYI:
- RB and AVL implementation use the BST implementation. So, when cloning any RB or AVL make sure to also clone BST.
